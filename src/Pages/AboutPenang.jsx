                    </h2>  
                    <p>Before British colonization, Penang was part of the Sultanate of Kedah. In 1786, Francis Light from the British East India Company secured Penang island from the Sultan of Kedah through a treaty. Under British settlement, Penang Island was called Prince of Wales Island and became part of the Straits Settlements together with Singapore and Malacca in 1826. Seberang Perai was also incorporated into the British colony by acting as a base for Penang Island. Seberang Perai plays a significant role by providing agriculture and also acting as a trade route connecting Penang Island to the mainland. </p>
                    <p>In 1948, Penang became part of the Federation of Malaya together with Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor and Terengganu. On 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained independence from British rule, marking the birth of a new nation. In 1963, the Federation of Malaya expanded to include Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore to form Malaysia. However, Singapore was separated from Malaysia in 1965, leaving the remaining states to continue as Malaysia until the present day. </p>
